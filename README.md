## Description

This project is a final take home challenge, completed in under 8 hours, which demonstrates knowledge of React, Javascript, Remote API endpoint, and CSS. As a user, you can view all of the top stories from the New York Times Top Stories API endpoint and select one to view more information about the article, including the link. If you want to find a specific article, there is a search bar at the top that will filter out the articles that do not include the user input.
